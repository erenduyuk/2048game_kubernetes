# 2048 Game Kubernetes,

This project deploys the 2048 game in a Kubernetes environment using Kind locally. It includes creating a Docker image of the game and running it on Kubernetes with a Deployment and NodePort service.

## 1- Game and Dockerization

The source code of the 2048 game is a web-based application and consists of HTML, CSS and JavaScript files. The source codes of this website are taken from the https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048 repository.

While containerizing the game, the first step was creating a Dockerfile. The Nginx image was chosen as the base to serve the game as a web application, and port 80 was exposed to allow external access. After the Dockerfile was created, the image was built and pushed to Docker Hub as erenduyuk/2048-image.

## 3- Create Deployment and Service

The 2048_deployment.yaml file contains definitions for a Deployment and a Service to run the 2048 game on Kubernetes. The Deployment is configured to run two replicas of the game, with each pod created using the erenduyuk/2048-image:latest Docker image.

The selector and labels within the Deployment ensure that the service and pods are correctly matched. Each pod exposes port 80, which serves the web-based interface of the game.

The Service section is designed to make the game accessible to the outside world. The NodePort-type service allows external access to the game from outside the Kubernetes cluster. The service selects pods with the deployment2048 label and directs incoming traffic to port 80 on those pods. NodePort assigns a port (e.g., between 32000â€“32767) for external connections, enabling access to the game through a web browser.
